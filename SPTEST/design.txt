=======>>
games,tables,users,settings,addons,(ev. ui)

davon soll es geben: 
1. DB (fuer alle users gleich, einfach grund info)
DB.games,DB.users,DB.addons,DB.tables,DB.settings,DB.ui

2. U (fuer diesen speziellen user, saved info)
U.games,U.addons,U.tables,U.ui,U.settings

3. Live (currently instantiated objects: tables,addons running!)
=>live means: live components
=>live instances can have different users,different everyting
=>this is just whatever has been created in this session is now in cache
=>live just means cache and should be treated as such
=>this is just to quickly switch and shutdown components
=>Current: this is the Live component that is currently active
this will determine: Settings,Pictures,Score,(AD)Addon,(G)Game,(T)Table,(U)User,UIS...

each Live component must have a shutdown (where important info is save to persistent storage)
shutdown (+save),instantiate (+load), activate, deactivate
gameloop: run: update, interactivate, processInput

- es muss einen manager geben der live components managed
- each live component has UI
- at deactivate UI is either deleted or otherwise disabled (if remains in background)

==>- muss dann noch ueberlegen wie ich die specs fuer RSG da einbaue!
