we are all agents interacting`

generally speaking, one might consider multiple layers of agent-environment interaction (eg., human, sentient beings including animals and plants, cells, particles, waves, fields...).

for sure, the social layer is most relevant in terms of human communication, and as you pointed out, whether 'other agents' are 'real' or just thoughts or perspectives within a single agent can neither be determined nor does it matter.

so let's talk about how mutiple agents may interact productively to maximize utility for the collective.

>`In other words, the collective intelligence is undoubtedly far superior than any individual's intelligence, so by optimizing the way the collective can achieve its goals each individual can harness that power (learn the models) and maximize their own utility far better than if they do everything themselves.`

wow! strong sentence! I completely agree because considering ALL perspectives must definitely lead to a better model than just considering a subset.

the problem seems to lie in finding an optimal way to communicate knowledge to each other.

>`If communication between humans weren't so efficient (not to say it's perfect by a long shot), then the equation changes and perhaps it wouldn't be worth trying to form a group`

well, here I somewhat disagree: I think communication is extremely inefficient in many ways and for many reasons, be it for humans limited imagination or 'openness' to new knowledge. It would be interesting to discuss reasons for ineffective communication. Could it be that it boils down simply to fear and greed (limbic system) what prevents us humans from cooperating effectively?

because, here is my next simplification: communication IS cooperation IS the sharing of knowledge. does that make sense?







also, I fully agree with your statement that 
so then, lets discuss collective goals.
definitely the one where we, 

as collective humanity, are, 

as you say, potentially 

wastly more intelligent than 

any single individual.

achieve common goals by 

collective decision making: 

I think you got one of the 

most interesting question 

here!

WOW! reading on, this next 

paragraph goes even deeper! 

is it acceptable in this 

discussion to simplify our 

model as follows:
1. share knowledge/communicate with other agents ...
